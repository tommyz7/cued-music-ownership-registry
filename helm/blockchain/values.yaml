## All env variables related to non-secret configurations (like services hostname and ports)
## are bundled into configmaps. Other sensitive data (like services credentials) is stored in
## secrets (sealed). Some configs and secrets are common to several services, while some other
## are specific to this service. This helm chart supports both config/secrets. All these
## settings are optional.
